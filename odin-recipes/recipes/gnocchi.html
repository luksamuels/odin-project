        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The warm flavors of squash and prosciutto are especially 
            comforting when paired with tender, oillowy gnocchi. To cut 
            down on prep work, we use shrink-wrapped, peeled, and seeded 
            squash halves from the produce section. We tested all types of 
            supermarket gnocchi fround in the pasta aile works best, but refrigerated 
            or frozen gnocchi can also be used here. If you don't have any on 
            hand, penne or campanelle also works well with this recipe.
        </p>

            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pound vacuum-packed gnocchi</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring 4 quarts water to boil in a large pot. Meanwhile, melt 
                1 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. 
                Add prosciutto and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Using 
                slotted spoon, transfer to paper towel-lined plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add remaining 3 tablespoons butter and squash to now-empty skillet and 
                cook until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add thyme and cook 
                until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in wine and cook until reduced 
                by half, about 3 minutes. Add broth and cook until slightly thickened, 
                about 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, add gnocchi and 1 tablespoon salt to boiling water and 
                cook until gnocchi float to surface, about 4 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup 
                cooking water, then drain gnocchi and return them to pot. Add squash 
                mixture and toss to combine. Add spinach and sture until just wilted, 
                adjusting consistency with reserved cooking water as needed. Stir in 
                prosciutto, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.
